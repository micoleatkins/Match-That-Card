### **_Description_**

####  Micole's Trivia is a fun challenging game that tests out your movie and song titles. This game will show if you're hip to what's cool or if you spent most of your life living under a rock :joy:! We will be highlighting genres such as pop, country, and hip hop artists. As for movies, I hope my audience get a nostalgic feeling while answering questions and reminiscing on funny moments. This game has no age restrictions and can be enjoyed by everyone!

### **_Getting Started_**
#### As you enter the website you'll first see that the main page explains the directions to the game. Next you'll click "Let's Go" to actually enter to the first trivia question. Each trivia question will be multiple choice, and you only have one chance to answer it before the answer is revealed to you. Once that is complete, the trivia question will load immediately after. There will be 2 levels in this game. You must answer all level 1 questions correctly in order to go to level 2. Once you've answered all questions correctly on level 2 you have won Micole's Trivia Game.

##### A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed here ....
